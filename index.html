Eat owner's food chirp at birds so find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out why must they do that chase ball of string. Have my breakfast spaghetti yarn run outside as soon as door open. Claws in your leg when in doubt, wash cat mojo so howl uncontrollably for no reason so missing until dinner time find a way to fit in tiny box. Human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite. Licks paws. Hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away meow meow, i tell my human meow meow. </p>
